<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>这篇文章可以看作是《Efficient MySQL Performance Best Practices and Techniques》的书摘，作者有着多年的MySQL实战经验，解释MySQL底层原理深入浅出，充满了真知灼见。</p>
<h3 id="chapter-1-query-response-time">Chapter 1 Query Response Time</h3>
<p>Do not begin by throwing hardware at the problem. Begin by using query metrics to
determine what MySQL is doing, then analyze and optimize slow queries to reduce
response time, and repeat. Performance will improve.</p>
<p>不要把问题归咎于硬件。利用查询指标搞清楚MySQL在做什么，然后分析和优化慢查询，以减少查询反应时间。性能终将得到提升。</p>
<p>The next three sections teach you about the following:
• Sources: query metrics originate from two sources and vary by MySQL distribution and version
• Aggregation: query metric values are grouped and aggregated by normalized
SQL statements
• Reporting: query reports are organized by a high-level profile and a query specific report</p>
<p>Query metrics originate from the slow query log or the Performance Schema.</p>
<p>两种慢查询的来源 ：slow query log和Performance Schema。</p>
<p>Load is relative to time but also subtly indicative of concurrency:  multiple instances of a query executing at the same time. Query load less than 1.0 means that,on average, the query does not execute concurrently. Query load greater than 1.0 indicates query concurrency. For example, a query load of 3.5 means that, any
time you look, you’re likely to see 3.5 instances of the query executing.</p>
<p>查询并发度：多个查询实例在同一时间执行查询。查询并发度小于1意味着没有查询在并发执行。查询并发度为3.5意味着在任何时间都有3.5个实例在同时执行查询。</p>
<p>Once you understand how MySQL executes a query, then you will understand how to optimize it. Understanding through analysis, then action through optimization.</p>
<p>The Performance Schema provides all nine essential query metrics.</p>
<p>Per</p>
<p>MySQL instruments a bewildering number of events that the manual defines as, “anything the server does that takes time and has been instrumented so that timing information can be collected.” Events are
organized in a hierarchy:
transactions
└── statements
└── stages
└── waits</p>
<p>InnoDB supports row-level locking, so it manages data access with row locks. Since InnoDB is
the default storage engine, row-level locking is implied unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>InnoDB支持行级锁，也是默认的存储引擎，所以数据库一般默认支持行级锁。</p>
<p>There are metadata locks managed by the server that control access to schemas,
tables, stored programs, and more. Whereas table locks and row locks control access
to table data, metadata locks control access to table structures (columns, indexes, and
so on) to prevent changes while queries are accessing the tables. Every query acquires
a metadata lock on every table that it accesses. Metadata locks are released at the end
of the transaction, not the query.</p>
<p>元数据锁</p>
<p>Locks are primarily used for writes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, REPLACE) because rows
must be locked before they can be written. Response time for writes depends, in
part, on lock time.</p>
<p>锁主要是为了写服务的，因为在写入之前一般要确保把行锁起来。</p>
<p>For reads (SELECT), there are nonlocking and locking reads. The distinction is easy
because there are only two locking reads: SELECT…FOR UPDATE and SELECT…FOR
SHARE. If not one of those two, then SELECT is nonlocking, which is the normal case.</p>
<p>读一般是无锁的。只有两种类型的的读是带锁的：SELECT…FOR UPDATE and SELECT…FOR
SHARE。</p>
<p>Nonlocking read does not mean non-blocking. SELECT queries must acquire shared
metadata locks (MDL) on all tables accessed. As usual with locks, shared MDL
are compatible with other shared MDL, but one exclusive MDL blocks all other
MDL. ALTER TABLE is the common operation that acquires an exclusive MDL.</p>
<p>非阻塞读不意味着完全无阻塞，会被ALTER TABLE阻塞。一般来说，shared MDL锁兼容shared MDL锁，但是一个exclusive MDL锁会阻塞其他所有锁。ALTER TABLE是exclusive MDL锁。</p>
<h4 id="rows-examined">Rows examined</h4>
<p>By contrast, the query SELECT c FROM
t1 WHERE id = 2 matches and examines only one row because there is a unique
index on column id (the primary key) and the table condition uses the entire index.</p>
<p>主键唯一且有索引的情况下只用扫描一行。</p>
<h4 id="rows-sent">Rows sent</h4>
<p>Rows sent is the number of rows returned to the client—the result set size. Rows sent
is most meaningful in relation to rows examined.</p>
<p>行返回是指返回给客户端的行数。</p>
<p>In fact, you can’t complete a query analysis without at least two pieces of metadata: the EXPLAIN plan
(also called the query execution plan), and the table structure for each table.</p>
<p>事实上，你不能在没有EXPLAIN命令和表结构的情况下完成对一个查询的完整分析。</p>
<p>The indirect “optimization” is: TRUNCATE TABLE. With no data, MySQL can execute any query in near-zero time. That’s cheating, but it nonetheless proves the point: reducing data size improves query response time.</p>
<p>减少数据量的大小也是提升查询反应时间的一种方法。</p>
<h3 id="chapter-2-indexs-and-indexing">Chapter 2 Indexs and Indexing</h3>
<p>Indexes provide the most and the best leverage. They are required for any nontrivial
amount of data. MySQL performance requires proper indexes and indexing, both of
which this chapter teaches in detail.</p>
<p>索引提供了最多和最好的杠杆。</p>
<p>Nothing special about table elem, right? It’s so simple, one might say it’s elementary.
But what if I told you that it’s not really a table, it’s an index?</p>
<p>以InnoDB为引擎的表也是索引。</p>
<p>InnoDB tables are B-tree indexes organized by the primary key. Rows are index
records stored in leaf nodes of the index structure. Each index record has metadata
(denoted by “…”) used for row locking, transaction isolation, and so on</p>
<p>InnoDB以主键组织起来的B树，行数据则放在叶子节点上。每行记录都有元数据用来处理行锁，事务隔离等。</p>
<p>Secondary indexes are B-tree indexes, too, but leaf nodes store primary key values.
When MySQL uses a secondary index to find a row, it does a second lookup on  the primary key to read the full row.</p>
<p>次级索引也是B树。次级索引叶子节点存储的是主键的值，当MySQL使用次级索引去查找行的时候，会利用第一次找到的主键值进行第二次查找。</p>
<p>There are three access methods:index lookup, index scan, and table scan. For an index lookup,
there are several access types: ref, eq_ref, range, and so forth.</p>
<p>MySQL有三种查找方式，索引查找，索引扫描，全表扫描。</p>
<p>There are two types of index scan. The first is a full index scan, meaning MySQL
reads all rows in index order.</p>
<p>利用次级索引中已排列好的顺序。</p>
<p>The second type of index scan is an index-only scan: MySQL reads column values (not
full rows) from the index.</p>
<p>利用次级索引中的值。</p>
<p>To use an index, a query must use a lefmost prefx of the index: one or more index
columns starting with the leftmost index column as specified by the index definition.</p>
<p>最左前缀匹配原则</p>
<p>The MySQL EXPLAIN command shows a query execution plan (or, EXPLAIN plan)
that describes how MySQL plans to execute the query: table join order, table access
method, index usage, and other important details.</p>
<p>EXPLAIN语句，用于解释表的连接顺序，索引使用情况。</p>
<p>ALL means a full table scan . index means an index scan. Any other value—const, ref, range, and so on—is an access type for an index lookup .</p>
<p>EXPALIN中的type：ALL意味着全表扫描，index意味着索引扫描，其他类型意味着索引查找。</p>
<p>Whenever you see type: ALL, possible_keys: NULL, or key: NULL, stop what you’re doing and analyze
the query.</p>
<p>当看到Explain的类型是ALL的时候，就必须对查询进行优化。</p>
<p>MySQL can use an index to optimize GROUP BY because values are implicitly grouped
by index order.</p>
<p>group by 语句也能充分利用索引。</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, MySQL can use an ordered index to optimize ORDER BY. This opti‐
mization avoids sorting rows, which takes a little more time, by accessing rows in
order.</p>
<p>不出意外的，order by也能充分利用索引。</p>
<p>The real output of EXPLAIN ANALYZE is wider, but I wrapped and numbered the
lines for print legibility and reference. EXPLAIN ANALYZE output is dense and requires
practice to grok.</p>
<p>EXPLAIN ANALYZE 能够输出更详细的执行时间细节。</p>
<p>Covering indexes are glamorous but rarely practical because realistic queries have too
many columns, conditions, and clauses for one index to cover. Do not spend time
trying to create covering indexes. When designing or analyzing simple queries that
use very few columns, take a moment to see if a covering index might work.</p>
<p>覆盖索引听上去很迷人，但实际用处很少。</p>
<p>Table join order is critical because MySQL joins tables in the best order possible, not
the order tables are written in the query. You must use EXPLAIN to see the table join
order.</p>
<p>表的连接顺序非常关键，使用EXPLAIN可以查看表的连接顺序。</p>
<p>MySQL can join tables without an index. This is called a full join and it’s the single
worst thing a query can do. A table scan on a single-table query is bad, but a full join
is worse because the table scan on the joined table does not happen once, it happens
for every matching row from the preceding table.</p>
<p>比全表扫描更糟的是在没有索引的列上进行连接。</p>
<p>hash join builds an in-memory hash table of values and uses that to lookup rows rather than doing repeated table scans. Hash join is a huge performance improvement.</p>
<p>Your job is simple: add or alter an index that you think will provide MySQL greater
leverage, then use EXPLAIN to see if MySQL agrees by using the new index. Repeat
until you and MySQL agree on the most optimized way to write, index, and execute
the query.</p>
<p>利用好索引这个杠杆。</p>
<p>As of MySQL 8.0.20, the hash join algorithm replaces the block nested-loop join
algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-3-data">Chapter 3 Data</h3>
<p>An index scan provides diminishing leverage as a table grows because the index also
grows: more table rows, more index values.</p>
<p>Finding matching rows is the fundamental purpose of a query, but even with a good index, a query can examine too many rows.</p>
<p>To see the execution plan that MySQL is not choosing, EXPLAIN the query with FORCE INDEX to use an index listed in the possible_keys field.</p>
<p>In light of this fact, MySQL DBAs commonly allocate memory for only 10% of total data size, usually rounded to standard memory values (64 GB, 128 GB, and so forth). 10% of 500 GB is 50 GB, so a DBA would probably err on the side of caution and round up to 64 GB of memory.This works surpassingly well and is a good starting point.</p>
<p>DBA一般会分配数据量10%的内存。</p>
<p>I define the principle of least data as: store and access only needed data. That sounds
obvious in theory, but it’s far from the norm in practice.</p>
<p>Efcient data access checklist
☐ Return only needed columns
☐ Reduce query complexity
☐ Limit row access
☐ Limit the result set
☐ Avoid sorting rows</p>
<p>只返回需要的列，降低查询的复杂度，限制查找行数，限制结果集的大小，避免排序</p>
<h3 id="chapter-4-access-patterns">Chapter 4 Access Patterns</h3>
<h3 id="chapter-5-sharding">Chapter 5 Sharding</h3>
<p>Sharding a database is the common and widely used technique of scaling out (or,horizontal scaling): increasing performance by distributing the workload across multiple databases. (By contrast, scaling up, or vertical scaling, increases performance by increasing hardware capacity.)</p>
<p>数据库分区有：Hash分区，Range分区，Lookup分区</p>
<h4 id="hash">Hash</h4>
<p>Hash sharding maps hash key values to shards using a hashing algorithm (to produce
an integer hash value), the modulo operator (mod), and the number of shards (N).</p>
<h4 id="range">Range</h4>
<p>Range sharding defines contiguous key value ranges and maps a shard to each</p>
<h4 id="lookup">Lookup</h4>
<p>Lookup (or directory) sharding is custom mapping of shard key values to shards.</p>
<p>Transactions do not work across shards. This is more of a blocker than a challenge
because there is essentially no workaround short of implementing a two-phase com‐
mit in the application.</p>
<p>事务在分区之间不起作用，除了两阶段提交没有别的解决方法。</p>
<p>A SQL statement cannot join tables across shards. The solution is a cross-shard join:
the application join results from multiple queries executed on multiple shards.</p>
<p>join在分区之间也不起作用，解决方法是跨分区join。</p>
<p>NewSQL refers to a relational, ACID-compliant data store with built-in support for
scaling out. In other words, it’s a SQL database that you don’t have to shard.</p>
<p>NewSQL：关系型，事务兼容，支持扩展且不用分区。</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, there are only two viable open source NewSQL solutions
that are MySQL-compatible: TiDB and CockroachDB.</p>
<p>When direct, manual sharding is too difficult, and NewSQL is infeasible, a middle‐
ware solution could help bridge the gap. The two leading open source solutions are
Vitess and ProxySQL, and they are entirely different. ProxySQL can shard and Vitess
is sharding.</p>
<p>手动分区是困难的，开源的分区解决方案有ProxySQL，Vitess。</p>
<h3 id="chapter-8-transactions">Chapter 8 Transactions</h3>
<p>Therefore, practically speaking, every MySQL query executes in a transaction by default, even a single SELECT statement.</p>
<p>每条SQL语句默认在事务中运行，即使是单个的查询语句。</p>
<p>Reads do not lock rows (except for SELECT…FOR SHARE and SELECT…FOR UPDATE),but writes always lock rows. That’s simple and expected, but the tricky question is:which rows must be locked? Of course, the rows being written must be locked. But in a REPEATABLE READ transaction, InnoDB can lock significantly more rows than it writes.</p>
<p>在可重复读隔离级别中，InnoDB会锁住比写入行更多的行。</p>
<h4 id="lock-type-abbreviation-locks-gap-locks">Lock type Abbreviation Locks gap Locks</h4>
<h5 id="record-lock-rec_not_gap-locks-a-single-record">Record lock REC_NOT_GAP Locks a single record</h5>
<h5 id="gap-lock-gap--locks-the-gap-before-less-than-a-record">Gap lock GAP ✓ Locks the gap before (less than) a record</h5>
<h5 id="next-key-lock--locks-a-single-record-and-the-gap-before-it">Next-key lock ✓ Locks a single record and the gap before it</h5>
<h5 id="insert-intention-lock-insert_intention-allows-insert-into-gap">Insert intention lock INSERT_INTENTION Allows INSERT into gap</h5>
<p>记录锁也称行锁，间隙锁，Next-key 锁，插入锁。</p>
<p>An UPDATE on table elem using the primary key to match rows acquires four data locks in the default transaction isolation level, REPEATABLE READ .</p>
<p>why lock the supremum pseudo-record,which includes all primary key values greater than 5, when the table condition excludes primary key values greater than 5?</p>
<p>在可重复读的隔离级别下，MySQL会用上next-key lock，Record lock</p>
<p>Why does InnoDB use next-key locks that lock the gaps instead of record locks? Because the transaction isolation level is REPEATABLE READ, but that’s only part of the answer.</p>
<p>SQL-92 standard allows phantom rows in REPEATABLE READ but InnoDB prevents them with next-key locking. But let’s not go down the proverbial rabbit hole by asking why InnoDB prevents phantom rows in REPEATABLE READ.</p>
<p>可重复读隔离级别避免了幻读问题。</p>
<p>Transaction isolation level READ COMMITTED disables gap locking, which includes next-key locks.</p>
<p>在读已提交的隔离级别下，MySQL不会用到gap lock和next-key lock。</p>
<p>In a transaction, READ COMMITTED has two important side effects:
• The same read statement can return different rows if re-executed.
• The same write statement can affect different rows if re-executed.</p>
<p>读已提交隔离级别有两个副作用：同样的查询语句返回不同的结果，同样的写语句能够影响不同的行。</p>
<h4 id="gap-locks">Gap Locks</h4>
<p>Gap locks are purely prohibitive: they prevent other transactions from inserting rows
into the gap.</p>
<p>间隙锁是完全禁止的，阻止其他事务插入到行的间隙中。</p>
<p>Gap locking is easy to disable by using READ COMMITTED. A READ COMMITTED transac‐
tion doesn’t need gap locks (or next-key locks) because records in the gap are allowed
to change, and each query accesses the latest latest changes (committed rows) when it
executes.</p>
<p>间隙锁在读已提交隔离级别中不可用。</p>
<h4 id="insert-intention-locks">Insert Intention Locks</h4>
<p>An insert intention lock is a special type of gap lock that means the transaction will
insert a row into the gap when the gap is not locked by other transactions.</p>
<p>Insert intention locks are compatible with (do not block) other insert intention locks. This is impor‐
tant for INSERT performance because it allows multiple transactions to insert different rows into the same gap at the same time.</p>
<p>In a sense, insert intention locks aren’t locks because they don’t block access. They’re
more like wait conditions that InnoDB uses to signal when a transaction can proceed
with an INSERT.</p>
<p>InnoDB has explicit and implicit locks and it only reports explicit locks. Explicit locks exist as lock structures in memory; therefore, InnoDB can report them. But implicit locks do not exist: there is no lock structure; therefore,InnoDB has nothing to report.</p>
<h4 id="mvcc-and-the-undo-logs">MVCC and the Undo Logs</h4>
<p>InnoDB uses multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) and undo logs to accomplish the A, C, and I properties of ACID.</p>
<p>InnoDB使用多版本并发控制和undo日志实现ACID中的ACI特性。</p>
<p>Multiversion concurrency control means that changes to a row create a new version of the row. MVCC is not unique to InnoDB; it’s a common method that many data stores use.</p>
<p>MVCC意味着给行创造了一个新版本。</p>
<p>Undo logs record how to roll back changes to a previous row version.</p>
<p>undo日志记录改变是如何回滚的。</p>
<p>If the original transaction executes SELECT a FROM elem WHERE id = 2 again, it
reads version 5 (that’s not a typo) but (figuratively) sees that that version is newer
than the point in database history established by its snapshot. Consequently, MySQL
uses the undo logs to roll back the row and reconstruct version 1, which is consis‐
tent with the snapshot established by the first SELECT statement.</p>
<p>如果初始事务第一次读到版本1，再次读读到版本5，MySQL会使用undo日志进行日志进行回滚到版本1，确保SELECT读到的数据是一致的。</p>
<p>Snapshots only affect reads (SELECT)—they’re never used for writes. Writes always
secretly read current rows, even if the transaction cannot “see” them with SELECT.</p>
<p>快照读只用于SELECT语句。</p>
<p>Transaction problems arise from the queries that constitute the transaction, how
quickly the application executes those queries, and how quickly the application commits the transaction.</p>
<p>MySQL is very patient—almost too patient. If the application does not commit a
transaction, MySQL will wait even until the consequences of that active transaction
ring its death knell.</p>
<p>如果应用不提交事务，MySQL会一直等待直到事务结束。</p>
<p>Either way, a large transaction is a large source of lock contention that can severely degrade write throughput and response time.</p>
<p>长事务会对占用大量的资源，并且降低写入和查询速度。</p>
<p>A long-running transaction takes too long to complete (commit or roll back). How
long is too long? That depends:
• Longer than acceptable for the application or users
• Long enough to cause problems (likely contention) with other transactions
• Long enough to cause a history list length alert</p>
<p>long-running transactions have two causes:
• The queries that constitute the transaction are too slow.
• The application executes too many queries in the transaction.</p>
<p>长事务之所以长：在事务中的查询语句时间长，在事务中执行过多的查询语句。</p>
<h4 id="report-latest-query-for-transactions-active-longer-than-1-second">Report latest query for transactions active longer than 1 second</h4>
<p>SELECT
ROUND(trx.timer_wait/1000000000000,3) AS trx_runtime,

WHERE
trx.state = &lsquo;ACTIVE&rsquo;
AND trx.timer_wait &gt; 1000000000000 * 1\G</p>
<p>InnoDB uses consistent snapshots in REPEATABLE READ transactions to make
reads (SELECT) return the same rows despite changes to those rows by other
transactions.</p>
<p>InnoDB使用一致性快照读使得读到的数据一致而不被其他事务影响。</p>
